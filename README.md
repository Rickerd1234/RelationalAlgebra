# Formalizing Relational Algebra and its Equivalence to First-Order Logic in Lean

This repository contains the formalization code and supporting materials for my thesis project: **"Formalizing the Relational Algebra and Its Equivalence to First-Order Logic in the Lean Proof Assistant"**, conducted at Eindhoven University of Technology.

## ðŸ“š Overview

Relational Algebra (RA) is the theoretical foundation of SQL and a cornerstone of database theory. It has a deep and well-understood connection to First-Order Logic (FOL), with known equivalences under active domain semantics.

This project formalizes:

- The core constructs of Relational Algebra (e.g. selection, projection, join, union, difference, renaming).
- A corresponding fragment of First-Order Logic with active domain semantics.
- The expressive equivalence between RA and FOL under this interpretation.

The formalization is developed in [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io), using its dependent type theory framework and the [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) library where possible.

## âœ… Goals

- ðŸ•‘ Formalize SPJR algebra.
- ðŸ•‘ Formalize SPJRU algebra.
- ðŸ•‘ Formalize complete relational algebra.
- ðŸ•‘ Formalize equivalent fragments of FOL.
- ðŸ•‘ Prove equivalence theorems between RA and FOL expressions.
- ðŸ”„ Ensure reusable and well-documented Lean definitions.
- ðŸ§© Contribute to or align with `mathlib4` standards.

## ðŸ§  Design Rationale

The design decisions behind the formalization â€” such as how tuples, schemas, and relational operations are represented in Lean â€” are documented in the [`Design.md`](./Design.md) file. This includes:

- Key trade-offs (e.g., bundled vs. unbundled representations)
- Justification for using partial functions and specific Lean constructs

Reading `Design.md` is recommended if you're contributing to the codebase or want to understand the reasoning behind implementation choices.
